              <p>The customer is entitled to 100% refund before our writers/editors start working on the project.
                If (for any reason) you change your mind and decide against continuing your project with us after

              <h5 class="h5-md">Incompetent Delivery:
              </h5>
              <p>Once the work is delivered, customers are only entitled to claim a refund once they have exhausted
                all the options detailed as under;<br>
                If it does not comply with project requirements (as requested/documented by the customer). We are

                the delivery is up to the mark. We assign, re-assign and re-write your work to ensure complete
                satisfaction.
                Reserve FREE Pages for future, but of same value and you can avail them at any time. <br>

              <p>In case of late delivery due to some minor technical errors, such as grammatical, typing, word count,
                missing references etc., refunds will be processed with mutual agreement and the company will only
                settle with partial refund or discounts reserved for future purchases.
